Strange Variety Vi Improved, or **swim**, is the ultimate text editor, written in Java.
Keybindings are similar to vi based editors. But this one is written in Java and runs in a JVM.

For the best experience, run with -XX:+UseZGC, as ZGC is the best garbage collector.

# Building #

Swim is using JDK 25, so make sure you have that installed.
In order to build swim, run the following command:

```
mvn clean package
```
